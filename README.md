# 🚀 Chat App

A full-stack realtime chat application built with React (Vite) frontend and Express + Socket.IO backend. Features include user authentication, realtime messaging, profile management, and media uploads.

This repo contains two apps:

- `frontend/` — Vite + React client
- `backend/` — Express + Socket.IO API server

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Realtime messaging using Socket.IO
- Authentication with JWT (stored in cookies)
- Zustand for lightweight client state
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI for design
- Optimistic UI updates for sending messages

---

## Demo


Live URL: https://chatsapp-yg5hm.sevalla.app/

---

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), Zustand, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Mongoose (MongoDB)
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas recommended)

---


## Requirements

- Node.js (>=22 recommended)
- npm
- A running MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)

---

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder (or use your platform's environment variable settings) with these variables:

- `PORT` (optional) — port backend listens on (default 3000)
- `MONGO_URI` — MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` — secret for signing tokens
- `CLIENT_URL` — frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for local dev or `https://your-app.vercel.app` for production)
- `NODE_ENV` — `development` or `production`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_*` — (if you use email or cloudinary features)

Frontend environment (Vite): add these to `.env` in `frontend/` or set them in Vercel as environment variables (prefix with `VITE_`):

- `VITE_API_URL` — full base URL for API (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api` or `https://api.yourdomain.com/api`)

Note: Vite only exposes client env vars with the `VITE_` prefix.

---

## Local development

Install dependencies and start both servers (separate terminals):

Frontend (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "D:/Chat App/frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "D:/Chat App/backend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs via Vite (default http://localhost:5173). The backend runs on port 3000 by default.

Important: the frontend's axios client uses an environment-configurable base URL. See `frontend/src/lib/axios.js`. In development it defaults to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

---



## API

Backend mounts routes under `/api`.

- Auth: `/api/auth/*`
- Messages: `/api/messages/*` (contacts, chats, user messages, send)

Example endpoints used by frontend:

- GET `/api/messages/chats` — list chat partners
- GET `/api/messages/contacts` — list all contacts
- GET `/api/messages/:id` — get messages by user id
- POST `/api/messages/send/:id` — send message to user id

## Contributing

> Thank you for your interest in contributing! We appreciate bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

How to contribute:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `master`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
```

2. Make changes, run the app locally, and add tests if possible.

3. Keep commits small and descriptive. Follow this pattern for commit messages:

```
feat: add user presence indicator
fix: correct message send endpoint
docs: update README
```

4. Open a Pull Request describing the change and link any related issue.

Guidelines:

- Use prefix-based branch names (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`).
- One logical change per PR.
- Add screenshots for UI changes and include reproduction steps for bugs.
- Be respectful and follow a friendly code of conduct in discussions.

If you're unsure about a large change, open an issue first to discuss design and impact.
